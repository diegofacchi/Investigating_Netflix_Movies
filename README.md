# Investigating_Netflix_Movies
 This repository contains a Python script for analyzing Netflix movie data using Pandas and Matplotlib. The script reads a CSV file containing Netflix data, filters for movies released in the 1990s, and visualizes the distribution of movie durations. It also counts the number of action movies from the 1990s with a duration of less than 90 minutes.
